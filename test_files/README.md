This folder contains the fasta files for 15 randomly selected proteins and the corresponding fragment files. I downloaded the fasta files from the PDB website https://www.rcsb.org/ and used Robetta http://robetta.bakerlab.org/fragmentsubmit.jsp to get the fragment files. 

*Note: When randomly selecting proteins, I ended up with just one protein, 6Q21, having four chains, Chains A, B, C and D. The rest of the proteins only have Chain A.
