This folder contains three proteins and their respective 3mer and 9mer fragment files. I used this to test the basicfolding.py script after making small adjustments. Because it's smaller, it takes less time to run which is helpful when editing. 


The output of running the script goes into the output_files directory. The pdb files show the best structure. There's also a subdirectory called rmsd_files, which contains the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the best structure aligned to the native structure.
