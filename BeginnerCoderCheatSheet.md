# For the novice coders! 
I had zero experience coding when I started in January 2021, so I spent a lot of time working on my coding skills and learning the Python language. Here are some resources I used to get started! 

[Swaroop's "A Byte of Python"](https://python.swaroopch.com/) This free programming book was wicked helpful when learning Python. I followed all the tutorials and did every exercise. It takes some time and I took a lot of notes, but it was great for building a foundation and understanding the syntax. For me, coding has its own jargon that was hard to translate and this book was a big help in learning that too.
