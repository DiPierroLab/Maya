Rosetta Commons is the hub for Rosetta modeling software. Under the "License and Download" tab on their Software page, you can find all the information and links
each software package (Rosetta Software Suite, PyRosetta and Foldit Standalone). I used PyRosetta. 
Here is the link to the Software page https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/license-and-download. (The links below are specific to my process obtaining a license 
and downloading the PyRosetta 4 version. But, if you want another software package, start on the Software page and use the links provided that correspond with the
software you want.)


Before installion, you have to get a license in order to down the PyRosetta package.

I used the Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion/MountainLion" (64-bit), Python-3.7.MinSizeRel version and followed the GNU/Linux and Mac OS X instructions under the section 
"Installation with an environment manager."
