Rosetta Commons is the hub for Rosetta modeling software. Under the "License and Download" tab on their [Software page](https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/license-and-download), you can find all the information and links for each software package (Rosetta Software Suite, PyRosetta and Foldit Standalone). I used [PyRosetta](http://www.pyrosetta.org/home) and all the following links are specific to my process obtaining a license and downloading the PyRosetta 4 version. But if you want another software package, start on the [Software page](https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/license-and-download) and use links that correspond with the software you want.


Before installion, you have to get a [license](https://els2.comotion.uw.edu/product/pyrosetta) in order to download the PyRosetta package. After obtaining your license, installation instructions, information about different builds and download links are available on the [PyRosetta Downloads page](http://www.pyrosetta.org/dow). I used the Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion/MountainLion" (64-bit), Python-3.7.MinSizeRel version and followed the GNU/Linux and Mac OS X instructions under the section 
"Installation with an environment manager."

The downloaded zip file is called PyRosetta4.MinSizeRel.python37.mac.release-285.tar.bz2, which I renamed PyRosetta4 for simplicity.
